Resume
======
This repository is where I'll be adding to and keeping my resume.  I ask that people don't outright copy it (because it would have my information on it), but if you want to use it or part of it as a template you can.  On that note, I'm not really looking for people to contribute to this because I don't think anyone could write a resume for me better than I can.  That being said, please let me know if you spot any grammar or spelling errors!

I decided to start keeping my resume in latex because I was getting a little frustrated with Microsoft Word's formatting. Also, I figured handing out a completed coding project to employers (with freely available source code) could only help my chances of getting a good job.  

Thanks for checking out my resume and if you're interested in hiring me let me know!  I need a new job every 8 months or so due to co-op so I'm looking for work more often than most!
